### PHYSVERSAL MOVEMENT SHOOTER SOURCE CODE AND ASSETS

Hello there! Thanks for checking the code of this project!

For releases, you can check the itch.io page https://wallmenis.itch.io/physversal

If you want to check the code or fork the projects, keep reading.

The source code, (that is the settings and the *.cs files of the project) is licensed under GPLv3.

It is one of my favorite source code licenses since it maintains that the game will remain free, even if I don't want to.

GPLv3 can be found in the LICENSE.md file on the root of the repo.

The rest (non source code files) are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Shareallike 4.0

The above license can also be found verbatim on the ASSET_LICENSE text file.
